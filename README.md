This is a little Java library that computes occurences of weekly and monthy transactions over a given time range.

I wrote this library to convert my [kidsbank](https://github.com/itzg/kidsbank-js/) application from using Quartz and needing to be long running over to being a stateless, [cloud run](https://cloud.google.com/run/)'able app.
